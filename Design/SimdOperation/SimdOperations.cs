 SIMD stands for Single Instruction, Multiple Data. It's a parallel computing architecture that allows a single instruction to process multiple data points simultaneously. SIMD is primarily used in vector processing 
How SIMD Works
Parallel Processing: SIMD operates on multiple data elements with a single instruction. For example, instead of adding two arrays element by element in a loop, SIMD can process multiple pairs of elements at once.

Vectorization: In SIMD, data is often organized into vectors or arrays. A single SIMD instruction can apply to an entire vector, making operations much faster.

Hardware Support: Modern CPUs and GPUs have specific instruction sets that support SIMD operations, such as:
